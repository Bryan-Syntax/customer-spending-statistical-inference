# Customer Spending Analysis Using Statistical Inference

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer spending patterns using statistical inference techniques. The goal is to uncover insights about customer behavior, identify significant factors affecting spending, and make data-driven decisions for business strategy.  

The analysis is performed using Python and popular data science libraries to handle data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical testing, and visualization.

---

## Objectives
- Understand customer spending behavior.
- Apply statistical inference methods to draw insights.
- Test hypotheses related to spending patterns.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation.
- **Probability Distributions:** Normal distribution, Bernoulli distribution, etc.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulating and testing hypotheses to identify significant factors.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Estimating population parameters from sample data.
- **Statistical Significance:** Understanding p-values and interpreting results.
- **Data Visualization:** Using charts and plots to explore and present data effectively.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains customer-level transactional data including:
  - Customer ID
  - Spending amount
  - Frequency of purchases
  - Demographic information (if available)
- The dataset is used to perform statistical analysis, segmentation, and inference testing.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation and cleaning
  - `numpy` – Numerical computation
  - `scipy` – Statistical tests
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment

---

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, format data types, remove duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Summarize data using descriptive statistics.
   - Visualize spending distributions and patterns.
3. **Statistical Inference:** 
   - Formulate hypotheses related to customer spending.
   - Perform t-tests, chi-square tests, or ANOVA where applicable.
   - Calculate confidence intervals to estimate population parameters.
4. **Interpretation & Insights:** 
   - Identify trends, patterns, and significant relationships.
   - Draw actionable business insights from statistical results.
5. **Visualization & Reporting:** 
   - Create charts, plots, and summary tables to communicate findings.

## Key Findings
- Significant differences in spending patterns between different customer groups.
- Statistical evidence supporting targeted marketing strategies.
- Confidence intervals provide estimated ranges for expected spending behavior.
- Insights can inform promotions, loyalty programs, and personalized recommendations.
